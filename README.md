Bootstrap for TDD Kata
======================

Basic bootstrap for .net and javascript for my team to practice [Roy Osherovs's TDD kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

The steps are captured in the Powerpoint file to discourage reading ahead!

The javascript test uses Jasmine and is self contained.  Just run SpecRunner.html in a browser and start editing the code and tests in the src and specs directory.

There is also a [jsFiddle for the Javascript version]http://jsfiddle.net/aaronheld/fZMQF/)
The .Net sample requires Visual Studio and [NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/)

The MSSQL example utilizes the [tSQLt Testing framework](http://tsqlt.org/).  There is a [red-gate product around tSQLt](http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-test/)

All samples are set at step 1 with a failing test.
